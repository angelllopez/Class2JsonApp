# Class2JSON

**Class2JSON** is a web-based utility designed to simplify the process of converting C# class definitions into JSON representations. This application is particularly useful for developers working with APIs, configuration files, or any scenario where JSON data is required based on C# class structures.

## Key Features:
1. **C# Class to JSON Conversion**:
   - Paste your C# class definition into the input area, and the application generates a JSON object with default values for each property.

2. **Default Value Handling**:
   - Automatically assigns default values to properties based on their data types (e.g., `0` for integers, `""` for strings, `false` for booleans).

3. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Simple and intuitive interface with two text areas:
     - Input: For pasting the C# class.
     - Output: Displays the generated JSON.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Provides meaningful error messages if the input is invalid or improperly formatted.

5. **Clear Functionality**:
   - A "Clear" button to reset both the input and output fields for a fresh start.

## Use Cases:
- **API Development**: Quickly generate JSON payloads for testing or documentation.
- **Configuration Files**: Create JSON-based configuration files from C# class templates.
- **Learning Tool**: Helps developers understand the mapping between C# classes and JSON structures.

This application is lightweight, efficient, and tailored for developers who frequently work with C# and JSON.
